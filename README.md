# Logistic-Regression-and-RMSprop-with-your-own-hands
## Description
With this notebook we will implement a linear classifier and train it using stochastic gradient descent modifications and numpy.

__What are we going to do:__
* view synthetic data;
* make the logistic regression model and some stochastic gradient descent modifications from scratch;
* analyze results of using different modifications.

## Description of folders
